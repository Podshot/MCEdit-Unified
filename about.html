MCEdit is a versatile map utility, designed for editing Minecraft maps. With it, you can open a <b>level.dat</b> file and fly around in glorious 3D with multiple levels of detail! Select millions of blocks and clone them anywhere else in the level. 
Fill a boxy selection with the block of your choice, or replace one kind of block with another. Export blocks to a <b>.schematic</b> file for later use. Import a schematic or an entire level into any world using the import tool. Move the player or his spawn point. 
Create and and remove chunks from the world. Fill blackened areas with light. Help us find <a href ="#Bugs">bugs!</a>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
MCEdit was first created to allow players to preserve anything built with several old versions of Minecraft and take them forward into newer versions of the game. 
It also aims to be forward-compatible with future (or even modified (check with <a href="http://www.mcedit.net/"> MCEdit 2</a> for that one)) versions of Minecraft. 
Over time (with the help of our lovely <a href="http://khroki.github.io/MCEdit-Unified/contributors.html">contributers</a>) it has since been improved with numerous brush tools for laying down blocks in different shapes, 
integration with the Minecraft Server to generate terrain using Minecraftâ€™s own seed algorithms, support for multiplayer worlds, and filters to edit mob spawners; change mob properties, command blocks, edit biomes and much more.
We also changed the name to MCEdit-Unified to give it a newer look since Codewarrior0 is now building MCEdit 2 and all the new features that the contributors had put in.

			Here's a quick overview of a few of the different tools we have:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="#Selection">Selection</a>: Make a selection by marking its corners. Press again to switch
				corners.<br>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="#Clone">Clone</a>: Copies the selected blocks. Click to set the copy down, then press &quot;Clone&quot;
				to clone.
				<span style="font-weight: bold">E R F
				</span> to transform blocks.<br>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="#Fill">Fill</a>: Fills the selection with a chosen block type, optionally replacing another type.
				<span style="font-weight: bold">R
				</span> to start replacing,
				<span style="font-weight: bold">E
				</span> to swap materials.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="#Pencil">Pencil</a>: Export the selection as a Schematic file for later use.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="#Crane">Crane</a>: Import a Schematic file or an entire level. Use this to convert older levels by
				importing them into an Alpha world.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="#Player">Player</a>: Click to move the player. Press twice to teleport.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="#Spawn">Spawn</a>: Click to move the player's spawn. Press twice to teleport.

				selection.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			There are a few <span style="font-weight: bold">Nudge</span> buttons scattered around. To use them, click and hold down on one. While holding the mouse button, use the
			movement keys (defaults: <span style="font-weight: bold">WASDQZ</span>) to move the related item around. Hold Shift to nudge further.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you have a powerful computer, press
			Control-F to see farther.
		</p>
		<h2 id="Selection">Selection Tools</h2>
		<p>
			Mark a selection using blue and yellow cubes. Here is a selection in progress.
			<br>
			<a href="doc/images/selection0.jpg">

			A selection.

			<a href="doc/images/selection1.jpg">
				<img src="doc/images/selection1.jpg" class="simg" alt="Image">
			</a>
		</p>
		<h2 id="Clone">Clone Tool:</h2>
		<p>
			Quickly copy blocks within the same level. The selected blocks are cloned into the green box and will
			follow your cursor around until you click.
			<br>
			<a href="doc/images/clone0.jpg">
				<img src="doc/images/clone0.jpg" class="simg" alt="Image">

		</p>
		<p>
			Click once, and your duplicate blocks
			are set down and will begin pulsating. Click again to pick them back up.
			<br>
			<a href="doc/images/clone1.jpg">
				<img src="doc/images/clone1.jpg" class="simg" alt="Image">
			</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Use the keys <span style="font-weight: bold">E R F</span> to rotate, roll, and flip the blocks.
			<br>
			<a href="doc/images/clone2.jpg">
				<img src="doc/images/clone2.jpg" class="simg" alt="Image">
			</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Press ENTER or click <span style="font-weight: bold">Clone</span> to expand public housing. The clone is finished when the selection is moved to the newly cloned object.
			<br>
			<a href="doc/images/clone3.jpg">
				<img src="doc/images/clone3.jpg" class="simg" alt="Image">
			</a>
		</p>
		<h2 id="Fill">Fill Tool:</h2>
		<p>
			You'll have to play around with this one on your own.
			<br>
			<a href="doc/images/replace.jpg">
				<img src="doc/images/replace.jpg" class="simg" alt="Image">
			</a>
		</p>
		<h2 id="Pencil">Pencil Tool:</h2>
		<p>
			Save the current selection as a &quot;schematic&quot; file. This file can be loaded into another level using the Crane. Nothing interesting to see here, unless you want a pic of a &quot;Save file...&quot; window.
		</p>
		<h2 id="Crane">Crane tool:</h2>
		<p>
			The crane tool lets you import blocks from different sources: It can place blocks previously saved by the pencil to a schematic. It can import <span style="font-style: italic">.inv </span> files created by <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?t=15921" class="postlink">INVEdit</a> as chests. It can import an entire level into another level. It will ask you to choose a level or schematic. After you've chosen, the level or schematic will appear in the green box. The blocks are fully loaded and ready to use, even though they appear
			slowly. Click to set it down.
			<br>
			<a href="doc/images/crane0.jpg">

			<br>Here, I've placed
			<a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;t=13796" class="postlink">the destroyed city.</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			As before, you can click to pick the blocks up, and use <span style="font-weight: bold">E R F </span> to rotate, roll, and flip them.
			<br>
			<a href="doc/images/crane1.jpg">
				<img src="doc/images/crane1.jpg" class="simg" alt="Image">
			</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Press ENTER or click <span style="font-weight: bold">Import</span> to construct. Constructions of up to 64 million blocks should take less than a minute. The copy is done once you regain control. You should press Control-S to save your level now. The lighting recalculation for this city took about 3 minutes on a Core i5.
			<br>
			<a href="doc/images/crane2.jpg">
				<img src="doc/images/crane2.jpg" class="simg" alt="Image">
			</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Et voila.<br>
			<a href="http://img413.imageshack.us/img413/4492/voila.jpg">
				<img src="http://img413.imageshack.us/img413/4492/voila.jpg" class="simg" alt="Image">
			</a>
		</p>
		<h2 id="Chunk">Chunk tool:</h2>
		<p>
			<img src="doc/images/chunk.jpg" alt="Image">
			<br>
			When you pick the Chunk tool, the visible selection is
			automatically expanded to cover all of the chunks it touches. Press <span style="font-style: italic">Create</span> to create all missing chunks in the selection, ignoring any chunks already present. Press <span style="font-style: italic">Destroy</span> to remove any chunks within the selection. Use <span style="font-style: italic">Prune</span> to keep all of the chunks in the selection, and delete the ones outside. All of these will ask you for confirmation because there's no way to undo them.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, you can press <span style="font-style: italic">Relight</span> to fix any bad lighting within the selected chunks. If other programs leave your level full of black spots, you can fix it with this.

			<h2>Download</h2>
			<a href="https://github.com/khroki/MCEdit-Unified/releases" class="postlink">
				Click here for downloads
			</a>
		</div>

		<br><br>
		Open and save the following formats, compressed or non:

		<p>
			-Alpha/Beta/Release PC version Maps (level.dat + folders)
		</p>

		<p>
			-Classic Indev (*.mclevel)
		</p>

		<p>
			-Classic Creative/Survival (*.mine, server_level.dat) **
		</p>


		** If your Classic level fails to load, or loads with the blocks all
		out of order, put the dimensions of the map into the filename, e.g.
		server_level_256_256_128.dat.
		<br>


		Import schematics created by MCEdit, schematics created by Redstone Simulator, and
		inventory files created by INVEdit. (as chests!)

		<br>
		<br>
		Make backups!

		<br>
		<br>
		Report any bugs to the <a href="https://github.com/Khroki/MCEdit-Unified/issues/new">Github Issues</a> page.

		<h2>Caveats</h2>
		<p>
			After increasing the window size, mouse input no longer works correctly.
			<br>
			Restart MCEdit to fix this.
		</p>
		<p>
			Support for non-English computers and foreign character sets is shaky. For best results,
			put the MCEdit folder directly into your C:\
		</p>
		<p>
			Creating and deleting chunks will save them to disk or delete them immediately.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cannot resize finite levels.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many tiles are replaced when converting from the older maps to Minecraft Alpha maps.  All cloth tiles are bleached white and any "Infinite" liquids are replaced with still liquids.
		</p>
		<p>
			The conversion also works the other way:  Blocks introduced since Alpha are converted to white cloth when moved to a Classic level. There is no way to control which blocks are replaced during a conversion.
		</p>
		<p>
			There is no conversion between the old Indev and the older Creative/Survival.
			<br>
			Take caution when copying between them.
		</p>
		<p>
			Classic levels require their dimensions to be in the file name, or else MCEdit will attempt to guess them based on the file's size.
