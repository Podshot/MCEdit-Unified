# TRANSLATION BASICS
#
# This file works by mapping original English strings(o##) to the new translated strings(t##)
# As long as the numbers match, it will translate the specified English string to the new language.
# Any text formatting is preserved, so new lines, tabs, spaces, brackets, quotes and other special characters can be used.
#
# The space (' ') separating the strings from the numbers is mandatory.
# The file must also be encoded in UTF-8 or it won't work. Most editors should support this.
#
# The first line of this file must start with #-# followed by a space and the Language (Country) pair.
#
# The second and third lines ca be used to specify particuliar fonts to use. They can be ommited.
#
# See TRANSLATION.txt for more detailed information.

t374 
o375 This filter is designed to search for NBT in either Entities or TileEntities.
It can also be used to search for blocks.
"Match by" determines which type of object is prioritized during the search.
Entites and TileEntities will search relatively quickly, while the speed of searching by Block will be directly proportional to the selection size (since every single block within the selection will be examined).
All Entity searches will ignore the block settings; TileEntity searches will try to "Match block type" if checked, and Block searches will try to "Match tile entity" tags if checked.
It is faster to match TileEntity searches with a Block Type than vice versa.
Block matching can also optionally match block data, e.g. matching all torches, or only torches facing a specific direction.
"Start New Search" will re-search through the selected volume, while "Find Next" will iterate through the search results of the previous search.
