# YAML Definition for the base Minecraft block types
#
# The library we're using apparently only supports YAML 1.1
# See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML or http://yaml.org/spec/1.1/
#
###
###
#
# Fields marked with * were added when updating this file for MCEdit + pymclevel
# The field "tex_data" is not used by MCEdit. To describe a block's alternate
# textures when the block's data value is different, use the "data" field to
# define block variants.
#
# Fields required by MCEdit: id, name, mapcolor, tex
#
# Fields also respected by MCEdit: data, tex_direction
#
###
###
#
# The basic structure of the YAML file consists of a name (which describes
# the set of blocks), and then a big list of the blocks themselves, either
# defined by "blocks" or "mlblocks."
#
# When using "blocks", X-Ray requires you to specify textures in terms
# of their (X, Y) coordinates within minecraft's terrain.png file, with
# (0, 0) being the upper left.  Valid ranges for each coordinate is zero
# through thirty one.  For example, the bookshelf texture is (3, 2), and the
# birch sapling is (15, 4).
#
# Additionally, X-Ray will allow you to specify a "texfile" attribute, if
# the texture sheet to be used isn't Minecraft's default terrain.png file.
# An example would be the Better Than Wolves mod, with which you'd specify
# "texfile: btwmodtex/btwterrain01.png"
#
# Using "mlblocks" instead of "blocks" will allow you to specify texture
# information in a way useful for mods that use a ModLoader-style texture
# definition, where each block's texture is defined in a separate graphic
# file.  For this kind of block, wherever a coordinate is required, specify
# the filename instead.  Note that using "mlblocks" will require you to
# additionally specify a "texpath" entry at the top level (alongside "name")
# which specifies the root directory under which the textures can be found.
# For example, a definition file for Aethermod blocks would have a texpath
# of "aether/blocks", and its block 170 (Icestone) would have a "tex" value
# of "Icestone.png"
#
# Required fields for each block: id, idStr, name, mapcolor, tex
#
#
# Brief descriptions of the individual block fields:
#
#   id: The numeric ID of the block
#
#   idStr: The block's name in Minecraft's internals. Used to find texture files in
#          Minecraft 1.5.
#
# * data: Defines variants of a block type, depending on the blockData value
#         for that block. Any field available for a block is also available
#         for a data variant. Replaces tex_data.
#         See the entries "Sapling" or "Slab" for examples.
#
#   name: The name that will show up in X-Ray if you're using it
#         as one of your highlights (unimportant otherwise)
#
# * aka:  Also known as. Alternate names or keywords to be used when searching
#         for a block by name. This field is also used as a hint when converting
#         blocks between level formats: The names of the source level's blocks
#         are matched against both the name and aka of the destination level's.
#
# * brightness: Light level produced by the block. Default is 0 (no light)
#
# * opacity: Light levels subtracted when light passes through the block.
#            Default is 15 (fully opaque)
#
#   mapcolor: RGB values for the minimap, 0-255
#
#   explored: If set to "true" this block will be checked for in X-Ray's
#        "explored" highlighting mode.  This field is not required, and
#        will default to "false."
#
#   tex: The "main" (and possibly only) texture to use for this block type.
#        In "block" lists, this must be (X, Y) coordinates, and in "mlblock"
#        lists, this must be a filename.  There are four blocks which don't
#        require this element: FIRE, PORTAL, WATER, and STATIONARY_WATER.
#        Our textures for those blocks are specially generated by X-Ray.
#
#
#   tex_direction: Sometimes blocks have different textures on
#         different faces.  If some faces aren't specified, the
#         default "tex" will be used.  Note that "tex" is always
#         required, even if all directions are overridden.  Valid
#         values are:
#             FORWARD
#             BACKWARD
#             SIDES
#             LEFT
#             RIGHT
#             TOP
#             BOTTOM
#
#   tex_direction_data: By default, X-Ray will render "FORWARD"
#         as if it's facing North.  Sometimes the data value of
#         a block will determine which way it faces, though, and
#         this is where you can specify that.  For example, the
#         Dispenser's definition is:
#             {2: NORTH, 3: SOUTH, 4: WEST, 5: EAST}
#
#         Note that currently only NORTH, SOUTH, WEST, and EAST are
#         supported.  Presumably I should add in UP and DOWN as
#         well, but that's a feature for another day.
#
#         Note: currently broken. Use damage values for now.
#
#   type: This determines how X-Ray will render the block.  The
#         default type is "NORMAL" which doesn't need to be specified.
#         Valid types are currently:
#
#             BED
#             BUTTON
#             CAKE
#             CROPS
#             DECORATION_CROSS
#             DOOR
#             FENCE
#             FENCE_GATE
#             FLOOR
#             HALFHEIGHT
#             LADDER
#             LEVER
#             MINECART_TRACKS
#             NORMAL
#             PISTON_BODY
#             PISTON_HEAD
#             PORTAL
#             PRESSURE_PLATE
#             GLASS
#             SEMISOLID
#             SIGNPOST
#             SIMPLE_RAIL
#             STAIRS
#             THINSLICE
#             TORCH
#             TRAPDOOR
#             WALLSIGN
#             WATER
#             VINE
#             HUGE_MUSHROOM
#             SOLID_PANE
#             CHEST
#             NETHER_WART
#             STEM
#             ENDER_PORTAL
#             ENDER_PORTAL_FRAME
#             CAULDRON
#             ENCHANTMENT_TABLE
#             BREWING_STAND
#
#         "SEMISOLID" refers to blocks which are cube-shaped but shouldn't
#         be considered fully solid by X-Ray's rendering engine.  Examples
#         are lava, fire, and mob spawners.
#
#         Note: this setting doesn't actually do anything for most types. Most rendering is set via renderer.py
#
#   tex_extra: This is a section to provide extra texture information for
#         block types which require it.  A list of the required tex_extra
#         attributes per block type are:
#
#         DOOR
#            The main texture specified should be the top part of the door.
#            "bottom" should be specified as the texture for the bottom.
#
#         LEVER
#            The main texture should be the lever itself
#            "base" defines the texture of the lever base
#
#         MINECART_TRACKS
#            The main texture should be the straight track.
#            "curve" should be the curved texture.
#
#         SIMPLE_RAIL
#            "powered" specifies the texture to use if the rail is powered.
#            Note that while this attribute only makes sense for the actual
#            "POWERED_RAIL" block, it's still required for any block type which
#            is of type SIMPLE_RAIL
#
#         CAKE
#            The main texture should be the top of the cake.
#            "side_uncut" should be the uncut sides of the cake
#            "side_cut" shoudl be the cut side of the cake
#            "bottom" should be the bottom
#
#         BED
#            The main texture should be the top "head" block (with the pillow)
#            "foot_top" is the top of the lower half of the bed
#            "foot" and "head" specify the textures at the very end of the bed
#            "foot_side" and "head_side" specify the sidesm for both head and foot
#

#            The main texture should be the compressed side-view texture.
#            "head" specifies the face of the piston head
#            "back" specifies the back texture of the body
#            "front" specifies the front of the body, drawn if the piston is extended
#
#        PISTON_HEAD
#            The main texture should be the regular (non-sticky) face of the head
#            "head_sticky" should be the sticky texture
#            "body" should be the main PISTON_BODY texture (used to get the sides of the head)
#
#        CHEST
#            The main texture should be the front face of the small chest.  The others
#            should be self-explanatory:
#            side_small, top, front_big_left, front_big_right, back_big_left, back_big_right
#
#        CROPS
#            The main texture should be the fully-grown crop texture.

#            "smaller_7" being the youngest.
#
#        NETHER_WART
#            The main texture should be the fully-grown nether wart texture.
#            "smaller_1" through "smaller_2" should be the various stages of growth, with
#            "smaller_2" being the youngest.
#

#            The main texture should be the outward "skin" texture of the mushroom.
#            "stem" specifies the stem texture
#            "pores" specifies the texture for pores
#
#        STEM

#            "curve" specifies the texture to use when curved towards its fruit
#
#        CAULDRON
#            The main texture should be the cauldron sides.
#            "inside" should be the inside faces
#            "top" should be the lip of the cauldron
#
#        ENCHANTMENT_TABLE
#            The main texture should be the top
#            "sides" should be the side textures
