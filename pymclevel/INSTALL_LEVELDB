LEVELDB INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR LINUX SYSTEMS
===================================================

In order to install this library, you will run the 'setup_leveldb.py' script.

It will try to solve the binary and library dependencies for you.

Ensure you're connected to internet. Some packages need to be
downloaded.


~~~~~~~~~~~~
DEPENDENCIES
~~~~~~~~~~~~

BINARIES
~~~~~~~~

These binaries/tools have to be installed on system in order to compile
leveldb_mcpe:

* g++
* make
* unzip
* wget or curl

The script will check them, and warn you if one (or more) can't be found.


LIBRARIES
~~~~~~~~~

You will need to have zlib v1.2.8 or v1.2.10 installed on your system.
Other versions can work, but no garantee..

If zlib is not found on your system, the script will build the version 1.2.10
specifically for PE support. See ZLIB section for more details.


~~~~~~~~~~~~
INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just open a shell, go to the 'pymcelvel' directory in MCEdit one and run
'python setup_leveldb.py' et voilÃ !
(Note that you'll have a lot of messages in the console, including warnings.
Don't pannic, and wait the end!)

You don't have to run this command as root. (Actually, DO NOT RUN IT AS ROOT!)
If the `python` command invokes Python 3, try with `python2`.

After a successful compilation, you'll have three new files in the 'pymclevel'
directory:

* libleveldb.so
* libleveldb.so.1
* libleveldb.so.1.18

Then you can run 'python test_leveldb.py' to verify the library can run.
You shall get an output like that:

> ...........................................................
> ----------------------------------------------------------------------
> Ran 59 tests in 88.650s
>
> OK


~~~~~~~~~~~~~
RECOMPILATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to recompile the library, you'll have to delete the libleveldb.so
files and the leveldb directory.

Then, run again the command as described in the INSTALLATION section.


~~~~
ZLIB
~~~~

The leveldb library need zlib to work.

The ideal version is 1.2.10, but PE support also works with 1.2.8.

If zlib is not found, the script will build it and 'install' it in the
'pymclevel' directory. This zlib library will be used only for PE support, and
will no be available for other applications on your system.

If zlib is found on your system, but with another version than 1.2.8 or 1.2.10
and leveldb compilation fails or does not work at runtime, it is possible to
force zlib compilation using the '--force-zlib' switch for the script.
