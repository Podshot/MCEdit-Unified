# the inputs list tells MCEdit what kind of options to present to the user.
# each item is a (name, value) pair.  name is a text string acting
# both as a text label for the input on-screen and a key for the 'options'
# parameter to perform(). value and its type indicate allowable and
# default values for the option:

# True or False:  creates a checkbox with the given value as default
#    int or float value: creates a value input with the given value as default
#        int values create fields that only accept integers.
#    tuple of numbers: a tuple of ints or floats creates a value input with minimum and
#        maximum values. a 2-tuple specifies (min, max) with min as default.
#        a 3-tuple specifies (default, min, max)
#    tuple of strings: a tuple of strings creates a popup menu whose entries are
#        labeled with the given strings. the first item in the tuple is selected
#        by default. returns one of the strings in the tuple.
#    "blocktype" as a string: creates a button the user can click to choose
#        a block type in a list. returns a Block object. the object has 'ID'
#        and 'blockData' attributes.

# this dictionary creates an integer input with range (-128, 128) and default 4,
# a blocktype picker, a floating-point input with no limits and default 15.0,
# a checkbox initially checked, and a menu of choices
