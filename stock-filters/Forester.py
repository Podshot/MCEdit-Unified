# Version 5
'''This takes a base MineCraft level and adds or edits trees.
Place it in the folder where the save files are (usually .../.minecraft/saves)
Requires mcInterface.py in the same folder.'''

# Here are the variables you can edit.

# This is the name of the map to edit.
# Make a backup if you are experimenting!
LOADNAME = "LevelSave"

# How many trees do you want to add?
TREECOUNT = 12

# Where do you want the new trees?
# X, and Z are the map coordinates
X = 66
Z = -315
# How large an area do you want the trees to be in?
# for example, RADIUS = 10 will make place trees randomly in
# a circular area 20 blocks wide.
RADIUS = 80
# NOTE: tree density will be higher in the center than at the edges.

# Which shapes would you like the trees to be?
# these first three are best suited for small heights, from 5 - 10
# "normal" is the normal minecraft shape, it only gets taller and shorter
# "bamboo" a trunk with foliage, it only gets taller and shorter
# "palm" a trunk with a fan at the top, only gets taller and shorter
# "stickly" selects randomly from "normal", "bamboo" and "palm"
# these last five are best suited for very large trees, heights greater than 8
# "round" procedural spherical shaped tree, can scale up to immense size
# "cone" procedural, like a pine tree, also can scale up to immense size
# "procedural" selects randomly from "round" and "conical"
# "rainforest" many slender trees, most at the lower range of the height,
# with a few at the upper end.
# "mangrove" makes mangrove trees (see PLANTON below).
SHAPE = "procedural"

# What height should the trees be?
# Specifies the average height of the tree
# Examples:
# 5 is normal minecraft tree
# 3 is minecraft tree with foliage flush with the ground
# 10 is very tall trees, they will be hard to chop down
# NOTE: for round and conical, this affects the foliage size as well.

# CENTERHEIGHT is the height of the trees at the center of the area
# ie, when radius = 0
CENTERHEIGHT = 55

# EDGEHEIGHT is the height at the trees at the edge of the area.
# ie, when radius = RADIUS
EDGEHEIGHT = 25

# What should the variation in HEIGHT be?
# actual value +- variation
# default is 1
# Example:
# HEIGHT = 8 and HEIGHTVARIATION = 3 will result in
# trunk heights from 5 to 11
# value is clipped to a max of HEIGHT
# for a good rainforest, set this value not more than 1/2 of HEIGHT
HEIGHTVARIATION = 12

# Do you want branches, trunk, and roots?
# True makes all of that
# False does not create the trunk and branches, or the roots (even if they are
# enabled further down)
WOOD = True

# Trunk thickness multiplyer
# from zero (super thin trunk) to whatever huge number you can think of.
# Only works if SHAPE is not a "stickly" subtype
# Example:
# 1.0 is the default, it makes decently normal sized trunks
# 0.3 makes very thin trunks
# 4.0 makes a thick trunk (good for HOLLOWTRUNK).
# 10.5 will make a huge thick trunk.  Not even kidding. Makes spacious
# hollow trunks though!
TRUNKTHICKNESS = 1.0

# Trunk height, as a fraction of the tree
# Only works on "round" shaped trees
# Sets the height of the crown, where the trunk ends and splits
# Examples:
# 0.7 the default value, a bit more than half of the height
# 0.3 good for a fan-like tree
# 1.0 the trunk will extend to the top of the tree, and there will be no crown
# 2.0 the trunk will extend out the top of the foliage, making the tree appear
# like a cluster of green grapes impaled on a spike.
TRUNKHEIGHT = 0.7

# Do you want the trunk and tree broken off at the top?
# removes about half of the top of the trunk, and any foliage
# and branches that would attach above it.
# Only works if SHAPE is not a "stickly" subtype
# This results in trees that are shorter than the height settings
# True does that stuff
# False makes a normal tree (default)
BROKENTRUNK = False
# Note, this works well with HOLLOWTRUNK (below) turned on as well.

# Do you want the trunk to be hollow (or filled) inside?
# Only works with larger sized trunks.
# Only works if SHAPE is not a "stickly" subtype
# True makes the trunk hollow (or filled with other stuff)
# False makes a solid trunk (default)
HOLLOWTRUNK = False
# Note, this works well with BROKENTRUNK set to true (above)
# Further note, you may want to use a large value for TRUNKTHICKNESS

# How many branches should there be?
# General multiplyer for the number of branches
# However, it will not make more branches than foliage clusters
# so to garuntee a branch to every foliage cluster, set it very high, like 10000
# this also affects the number of roots, if they are enabled.
# Examples:
# 1.0 is normal
# 0.5 will make half as many branches
# 2.0 will make twice as mnay branches
# 10000 will make a branch to every foliage cluster (I'm pretty sure)
BRANCHDENSITY = 1.0

# do you want roots from the bottom of the tree?
# Only works if SHAPE is "round" or "cone" or "procedural"
# "yes" roots will penetrate anything, and may enter underground caves.
# "tostone" roots will be stopped by stone (default see STOPSROOTS below).
# There may be some penetration.
# "hanging" will hang downward in air.  Good for "floating" type maps
#    (I really miss "floating" terrain as a default option)
# "no" roots will not be generated
ROOTS = "tostone"

# Do you want root buttresses?
# These make the trunk not-round at the base, seen in tropical or old trees.
# This option generally makes the trunk larger.
# Only works if SHAPE is "round" or "cone" or "procedural"
# Options:
# True makes root butresses
# False leaves them out
ROOTBUTTRESSES = True

# Do you want leaves on the trees?
# True there will be leaves
# False there will be no leaves
FOLIAGE = True

# How thick should the foliage be
# General multiplyer for the number of foliage clusters
# Examples:
# 1.0 is normal
# 0.3 will make very sparse spotty trees, half as many foliage clusters
# 2.0 will make dense foliage, better for the "rainforests" SHAPE
FOLIAGEDENSITY = 1.0

# Limit the tree height to the top of the map?
# True the trees will not grow any higher than the top of the map
# False the trees may be cut off by the top of the map
MAPHEIGHTLIMIT = True

# add lights in the middle of foliage clusters
# for those huge trees that get so dark underneath
# or for enchanted forests that should glow and stuff
# Only works if SHAPE is "round" or "cone" or "procedural"
# 0 makes just normal trees
# 1 adds one light inside the foliage clusters for a bit of light
# 2 adds two lights around the base of each cluster, for more light
# 4 adds lights all around the base of each cluster for lots of light
LIGHTTREE = 0

# Do you want to only place trees near existing trees?
# True will only plant new trees near existing trees.
# False will not check for existing trees before planting.
# NOTE: the taller the tree, the larger the forest needs to be to qualify
# OTHER NOTE: this feature has not been extensively tested.
# IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS: SET TO False
